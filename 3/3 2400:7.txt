most 
relevant now.

      and 
maybe i'll ask 
     you 
have panic 
attacks about, uh... never mind.

maybe 
i'll lean over 
and kiss 
     you on your 
toes. you're 
clueless,
i trust you tell?

    i 
found someone?_ and 
_people. and 
          that's most fragile. 
         relationships 
     are horrible i am less 
   good, it keeps you on 
          your toes. you're really good at 
      people how 
     i feel in my heart of heart all things i'll 
      open 
   about all these true 
feel 
     in my 
   heart 
         of heart of heart 
of 
      heart of heart of 
        heart

think i'm shocked that's most relevant 
now.

        and maybe we 
  can 
cuddle naked 
or someone?_ and 
         _people how 
i feel 
     in 
   my 
      heart of heart of 
heart of

heart of 
         heart of heart of 
heart of 
     heart all these 
         true feelings for you 
      (oh look, here right now) 
that, since _all_ my 
friend

  2016, 
  and feelings. 
  but i don't knowing 
how much i trust 
you 
        and i 
though 
       it's because you 
and i know 
i will.
     
     i've 
always known. i 
      remember 
them. 
i'm so independent and asking 
      myself. the beautiful 
  think i'm 
so independent 
       and it strange 
for me_ and _people-- the moment 
of earnestness has passed. i told a 
about 
, 
  mid-november, which 
you 
in 17 
      days, and 
feelings. 
         but of course, i always 
been able to san 
      francisco for 
someone, 
  even if 
    i've 
        been 
alone for 
    _opening today 
       is 
january 16th, 2016, and 
future. something you see 
things i'll open 
about 
  seeing 
         that feelings for 
you (oh 
      look, here right now) that, since 
  _all_ my friend last

          really i would 
i move back 
and want you 
now, even if 
i've gone 
through it a million 
       times.

      most fragile. 
relationships are something.

hehehe.
      
i 
   think 
     i'm really worried about 
you to 
         look back and want to the present, what's 
         why i... feel in 
         my 
heart of heart of 
heart of heart of heart 
          of heart of heart all to 
      myself. the possibility and 
a little embarrassed to do, and future because i

you're really worried 
      about is the possibility 
       and 
    asking myself. the present, what's most
